# Instagram-Followers
Project to catch followers who do not follow back on Instagram

The project will be performed through downloaded data from Instagram:

1. Through data download request through Instagram. The downside is the wait for the company to send the desired information.

Instagram Data Analysis Visualizations:
1. Number of followers: 1074
2. Number of following: 1026

A total of 238 followers that I do not follow back and a total of 190 accounts I follow but they don't follow me back. There is a total of 1074 followers compared to 1026 accounts I follow. The analysis provides a comprehensive overview of your Instagram engagement, focusing on mutual and non-reciprocal follows, follower growth, and the dynamics over the years.

This visualization, titled "Cumulative Non-Reciprocal Follows Over Time," effectively shows how the count of people you follow who don't follow you back has increased over the years. The following insights can be drawn from this chart:

1. Steady Growth: There is a gradual but consistent increase in non-reciprocal follows over time. This suggests that as your social circle grew, the number of people who didnâ€™t follow you back also increased steadily.

2. Key Growth Periods:

    You might notice periods where the growth is faster, potentially indicating times when you followed more users without receiving reciprocal follows. This could correlate with specific activities, like participating in events or expanding social reach during certain years.\
3. Long-Term Trends:

    The steady growth over the years could also point to typical behavior on platforms like Instagram, where users may follow others for updates or content without expecting a reciprocal follow.\
4. Cumulative Impact:

    The cumulative count reaching close to 200 by 2024 emphasizes the importance of regularly reviewing your connections if you're keen on optimizing mutual engagement.

Continue monitoring yearly growth and cumulative trends to adapt strategies. Highlight any personal milestones or content shifts during periods of significant change for better contextual understanding.
